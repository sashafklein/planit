    :notes: To exhaust the metaphor, La Vitrola is the culinary kingpin of Cartagena.
      ... Part jazz club, part lounge, part highly touted restaurant, La Vitrola channels
      old Havana — whirring ceiling fans, swaying palm fronds, slatted window shutters
      that throw the light just so. ... It would have been easy to spend the rest
      of the trip at La Vitrola, but it was time to move on.

    :notes: Colombian food has been hiding,” said Felipe Arboleda, the boyish, perpetually
      smiling former chef at Palma, one of the city’s white-hot restaurants. ... Eight-18
      shares its aesthetic sensibility with Palma — white, white, white — with accents
      of green.

    :notes: 'The word on 8-18 was that it had come through its celebratory opening
      three years ago with its culinary edge intact. ... The menu at 8-18 is Colombian
      by way of Spain. ... We followed all that rawness with seared scallops tossed
      with parsley and lemon juice (24,000 pesos), warm mussels with crispy mixed
      greens (20,000) and Coco 8-18, a creamy fish soup thick with shrimp, cabbage,
      green onions and coconut milk (24,000). ... Instead, we ended the meal as we
      started it: with cold, minty, palate-cleansing mojitos — which, matched the
      décor seamlessly — and pronounced that 8-18 still rises to the hype.'

      and as close to a perfect meal as I found.
