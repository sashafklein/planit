    :notes: We were on the crowded dance floor of a disco on the second floor of a
      nondescript office building tucked at the end of a little alley in Shinjuku
      Ni-chome, Tokyo’s gay district. ... This is who we are in Tokyo, where it seems
      nothing is as it should be back home, even if we want it to be. ... My plan
      was to revisit all of my favorite places, starting with recreating my very first
      night in Tokyo nearly a decade ago, when Ken, a friend of a friend who was eager
      to show a gaijin (foreigner) around, first took me through a portal to a world
      that I never would have discovered on my own. ... Nonbei Yokocho is one of several
      spots the author of the accompanying article, once a resident of Tokyo, has
      explored in the city. ... DJ Naoto at New Sazae Disco &amp; Bar, which is on
      the second floor of an office building in Shinjuku Ni-chome, Tokyo&#8217;s gay
      district. ... He helped me unearth what felt like the real Tokyo of side streets
      and back ways, like Nonbei Yokocho (Drunkard’s Alley), a quiet passageway lit
      up with red Japanese lanterns just across from the chaos of Shibuya Station.
      ... Ever since I left Tokyo, I’d been providing friends, colleagues, and anyone
      else passing through, with directions to these establishments and others on
      a list of my favorite spots, most of which I had I picked up from Ken and my
      other Japanese friends. ... I wanted this itinerary to be the next best thing
      to having a Japanese friend, an entree into Tokyo beyond the incense-scented
      shrines, five-star hotel hospitality and raucous Roppongi district (which I
      avoided like the plague). ... Continue reading the main story The list feels
      so vital because not only do very few Japanese speak English, but Tokyo also
      has a maze of unnamed streets and cultural barriers. ... Continue reading the
      main story Continue reading the main story I was led there by my foodie friend
      Yukari Iwatani Kane, a journalist and author who picked up where Ken left off,
      introducing me to Tokyo’s most delectable restaurants. ... During my nostalgic
      bar hop with Ken and meal of lightly battered sea urchin tempura with Yukari,
      I had blocked out the downside to the hidden Tokyo. ... The memory of that suffocating
      lonesomeness hit me one afternoon at the Spa LaQua in Tokyo Dome City. ... The
      spa, built under a roller coaster that passes overhead every few minutes (relaxing
      in Tokyo has its limits), offers outdoor and indoor onsens (hot baths), earwax
      cleaning and a chilly room where spagoers can watch languid jellyfish bob up
      and down, said to aid with stress relief. ... As we left the spa I had a mild
      panic attack and pleaded with Robert to call United and get us on the next flight
      out of Tokyo. ... One bite of Taira-san’s unagi with sea salt and we decided
      to give Tokyo a few more days.
