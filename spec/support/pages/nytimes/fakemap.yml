    notes: "We were on the crowded dance floor of a disco on the second floor of a nondescript office building tucked at the end of a little alley in Shinjuku Ni-chome, Tokyo’s gay district. ... This is who we are in Tokyo, where it seems nothing is as it should be back home, even if we want it to be. ... My plan was to revisit all of my favorite places, starting with recreating my very first night in Tokyo nearly a decade ago, when Ken, a friend of a friend who was eager to show a gaijin (foreigner) around, first took me through a portal to a world that I never would have discovered on my own. ... Nonbei Yokocho is one of several spots the author of the accompanying article, once a resident of Tokyo, has explored in the city. ... DJ Naoto at New Sazae Disco &amp; Bar, which is on the second floor of an office building in Shinjuku Ni-chome, Tokyo&#8217;s gay district. ... He helped me unearth what felt like the real Tokyo of side streets and back ways, like Nonbei Yokocho (Drunkard’s Alley), a quiet passageway lit up with red Japanese lanterns just across from the chaos of Shibuya Station. ... Ever since I left Tokyo, I’d been providing friends, colleagues, and anyone else passing through, with directions to these establishments and others on a list of my favorite spots, most of which I had I picked up from Ken and my other Japanese friends. ... I wanted this itinerary to be the next best thing to having a Japanese friend, an entree into Tokyo beyond the incense-scented shrines, five-star hotel hospitality and raucous Roppongi district (which I avoided like the plague). ... Continue reading the main story The list feels so vital because not only do very few Japanese speak English, but Tokyo also has a maze of unnamed streets and cultural barriers. ... Continue reading the main story Continue reading the main story I was led there by my foodie friend Yukari Iwatani Kane, a journalist and author who picked up where Ken left off, introducing me to Tokyo’s most delectable restaurants. ... During my nostalgic bar hop with Ken and meal of lightly battered sea urchin tempura with Yukari, I had blocked out the downside to the hidden Tokyo. ... The memory of that suffocating lonesomeness hit me one afternoon at the Spa LaQua in Tokyo Dome City. ... The spa, built under a roller coaster that passes overhead every few minutes (relaxing in Tokyo has its limits), offers outdoor and indoor onsens (hot baths), earwax cleaning and a chilly room where spagoers can watch languid jellyfish bob up and down, said to aid with stress relief. ... As we left the spa I had a mild panic attack and pleaded with Robert to call United and get us on the next flight out of Tokyo. ... One bite of Taira-san’s unagi with sea salt and we decided to give Tokyo a few more days."

    notes: "We followed them as they pushed their tiny collapsible bicycles through the streets of Shinjuku to the Albatross G, a compact three-story saloon with blood-red walls, and one of hundreds of tiny bars squeezed into Golden Gai, a hodgepodge of alleyways, some only wide enough for a single person. ... We continued our night with Ken not far from the Albatross G at Omoide Yokocho (which, depending on whom you ask, is known in English as Memory Lane or Piss Alley), an alley lined with closet-size yakitori restaurants."
