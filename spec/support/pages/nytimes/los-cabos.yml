    :notes: Book a table in advance, as well as a 30-minute field tour to get the
      lay of the land and spy the new “culinary cottages” that are also available
      for rent. Then start dinner with a garden-fresh watermelon-basil-mint Farm Julep
      and bread from the wood-fired oven. The menu changes according to the available
      produce but usually includes pizzas, salads and freshly caught fish.

      zip-line course or drive an ATV through the desert to the beach and back.

      a helmet and life jacket and strap their feet into boot-style bindings attached
      to a board. Twin water jets are connected to an instructor's Jet Ski via a 60-foot
      pressurized hose, which, at the instructor's control, will propel the rider
      into the air up to 45 feet.
