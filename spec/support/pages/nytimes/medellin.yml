    :notes: Medellin's public transportation system of airborne gondolas cruise up
      the hillside like ski-lifts. Hop on at Acevedo station, then transfer from the
      aboveground Metro, and sail up the mountain over brick houses with corrugated
      metal roofs.

    :notes: This Cuban-themed salsa joint in the trendy Laureles neighborhood, has
      a nine (or more) member band playing on Thursday and Saturday nights. It's a
      small place and not fancy, but the atmosphere is electric, the music is sparkling,
      and the dance skills are mesmerizing. Settle in with an Aguila beer.

    :notes: One of the city's most forward-thinking infrastructure investments was
      the creation of outdoor escalators that run up the steep hillside leading to
      Comuna 13, a gang-plagued neighborhood formerly isolated by its position atop
      stairs equivalent to a 28-story building. Take the escalators (staffed by security
      guards, many from the neighborhood) to the top, where you'll have excellent
      views of the city, as well as the riot of primary colors and murals that were
      added to the buildings when the escalators opened.

    :notes: While many of the exhibits dedicated to Colombia's years of civil war
      between the government (and its paramilitary groups) and leftist guerrillas
      are artistic rather than explanatory, there's a timeline that's useful for putting
      events in perspective.

    :notes: Craft beers are gaining traction in Colombia and you can sample them at
      Cerveceria Libre. The owners brew their own stout, IPA and more in the back,
      but at the bar they also serve craft beers from other Colombian microbreweries.

      (even the tonic is house-made).
