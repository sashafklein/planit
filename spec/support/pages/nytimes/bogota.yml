This hilly neighborhood, which is lined with turquoise, pink and orange buildings, has an air of downtown obscurity that attracts a fashionable, in-the-know crowd. The trendsetters can be spotted at Valenzuela Klenner Galería (Carrera 5 No. 26-28; 57-1-243-7752; vkgaleria.com), a contemporary art gallery once visited by wealthy drug lords looking for trophy paintings of lions but disappointed by its avant-garde offerings. Nearby is a local artisanal leather workshop, Giraldo Taller Manual del Cuero (Carrera 5 No. 26A-18; 57-1-342-8964; tallermanualdelcuero.blogspot.com), which stitches sumptuous leather handbags, briefcases, belts and backpacks in every color imaginable. And next door is the Luvina bookstore (Carrera 5 No. 26A-06; 57-1-284-4157), where local writers hold forth with admirers."

The tables, draped in white, are spaced far apart and illuminated by candles; the terrace is warmed by gas lamps; jazz wafts gently through the place. Order the daily tasting menu. A recent one included a millefeuille of apple slices stuffed with crab meat and white fish; yuca cakes filled with meat; and a grilled lobster tail on a bed of green plantains. The tasting menu is 120,000 Colombian pesos, or $65 at 1,840 pesos to the dollar."

Play it safe at BarDeLeo (Calle 27b No. 6-73; 57-1-286-0539; bardeleo.com/en), where new mingles easily with old. In the drug-tinged days, the place was reputed to serve martinis spiked with marijuana. Today, it has become a less controversial but no less creative producer of cocktails. The walls are a deep red, as are the shades on the chandelier; Cuban son music might be played live behind you. Try the starfruit (carambolo) and aguardiente martini — aguardiente being an anise-flavored, sugarcane-based drink, a Colombian favorite."

But until recently, Andres Carne de Res, a beloved spot that offers a hard-to-explain combination of steakhouse and all-night dance party, was situated in the remote outskirts of town. Thankfully, last year the club opened a branch downtown (Calle 82 No. 12-21; 57-1-863-7880; andrescarnederes.com). Come early, install yourself at a table and feast on its famous steak (the peppery lomo sellado is excellent), washed down with a customary bottle of rum. Dinner is about 160,000 pesos for two, without alcohol. Then, as the music grows louder and the night grows older, the place morphs into a nightclub. Professional dancers in blue mink coax you onto the floor. If you leave six hours after you came, you’re leaving too early."
