      mirrors by Thomas Chippendale, 19th-century carpets woven in the Silk Road city
      of Samarkand, a carved altar from a church in Goa.'

      that mix clear acrylic surfaces with traditional textiles, as well as Nichts
      Neues, an emporium of retro cinema seats, industrial lamps, mid-century modern
      Scandinavian furniture and other vintage treasures.

    :notes: Resplendent with horseshoe arches, geometric mosaic floors, Arabesque
      swirls of chiseled plaster and other Moorish flourishes, the disused 19th-century
      mansion across from Praço do Principe Real was reborn in 2013 as a neo-sultanic
      “Conceptual Shopping Gallery.”

      stands. Among them is Charcutaria Lisboa, where aged, air-cured hocks of acorn-fed
      porco preto are finely sliced into fatty red ribbons.

    :notes: Room 61 of the museum shakes the soul. “Salome,” by Lucas Cranach the
      Elder, is an early 16th-century depiction of that celebrated seductress holding
      the grisly severed head of John the Baptist. But the most unnerving image is
      Hieronymus Bosch's “Triptych of the Temptations of Saint Anthony Abbot, the
      Betrayal of Christ and the Way to Calvary,” which unleashes a feverish nightmare
      of monsters and debauched humans in a fiery apocalypse.
