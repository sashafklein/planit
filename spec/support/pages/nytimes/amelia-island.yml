      note: "In addition to the rich collection of houses that have earned Fernandina Beach a spot on the National Register of Historic Places, the town apparently also has more than its fair share of ghostly residents, from Charlie Beresford, who tended bar at the Palace Saloon for 54 years until his death in 1960 and even now puts in an appearance, to Celeste Eppes, a raven-haired beauty who supposedly haunts her family's Victorian mansion. If Joe Anderson, a director of the excellent Amelia Island Museum of History, is leading his Ghost Tour through the town's streets, join in. (His stand-ins don't have quite the same verve, if a recent tour was any indication.) Tours start at St. Peter's Episcopal Church Cemetery (Alachua and Eighth Streets, 904-261-7378). Tours are $10 for adults and $5 for ages 12 and under."

      note: "One of the local residents' favorite restaurants isn't actually on Amelia Island. The Down Under (4883 Otis Trail, Fernandina Beach; 904-277-1557), a rambling fish shack owned by the McCarthy family, is literally ''down under'' the Shave Bridge, hard by the Intracoastal Waterway and the tracks of what was once the Florida Railroad Company. (Leaving the island, take the first left after crossing the bridge and follow the dirt road.) The restaurant serves things like baked grouper with chipotle butter ($17.95), but you want the fried shrimp ($16.95). Straight from local waters, they're dipped in a light batter and deep-fried to a crunch."

      note: "Held every Saturday morning under the trees in Central Park (11th and Centre Streets, 9:00 to 2 p.m.), Fernandina's farmers' market is a low-key neighborly affair with just a dozen or so vendors selling everything from organic greens to homemade tamales to peel-and-eat shrimp. Nick Stillwell's pecans alone are worth the stop -- the rich-tasting paper-shell versions (Mr. Stillwell says they are Kanoodles, from southwest Georgia) can be cracked by hand ($10 for a three-pound bag)."

      note: "A trip down Amelia's main drag, A1A, takes you past humble Florida beach bungalows, newer McVillas and the gates of luxury resorts to the Amelia Island State Recreation Area at the island's very tip. You can see Amelia's best beaches from the back of a horse by booking a ride ($45 an hour) with the Kelly Seahorse Ranch (7500 First Coast Highway, 904-491-5166). After a quick lesson on steering, Jim Kelly leads groups on a stretch of sand where the only neighbors are likely to be terns, egrets and pelicans, as well as the surf-casters who have driven their 4-by-4's onto the beach. The trail rides are mostly at a walk. Don't worry, the scariest part is the waiver form: ''Horses are 5 to 15 times larger, 20 to 40 times more powerful, and 3 to 4 times faster than a human.''"

      note: "Amelia's 13 miles of beachfront are dotted with parks and beach access points. Pick up a picnic at Gourmet Gourmet (1408 Lewis Street, 904-261-8973) where there are about 20 sandwiches ($6.95 to $8.95) to choose from, including the Caribe (a Cuban sandwich wrap with roasted red pepper aioli), as well as blackberry jasmine iced green tea ($2) and Key lime pie ($3.95 a slice). To take a quick detour into history, continue down Lewis Street to the community of American Beach. Founded by the Afro-American Life Insurance Company in 1935, when Florida's public beaches were mostly off limits to African-Americans, this was a flourishing black beach community through the 1950's. (It's also the basis -- and the location -- of Lincoln Beach in John Sayles's 2002 film, ''Sunshine State.'') You can go to the beach here or head to Peter's Point Park (A1A and Amelia Island Parkway) where there are shaded pavilions, restrooms and outdoor showers."

On the first weekend of every month, re-enactors live at the fort just as Union troops did after taking it without a fight. Even more impressive is the park's fishing pier, which stretches a half-mile into the ocean (it's thought to be the longest fishing pier on the East Coast). Patient anglers stand and wait for the sheepsheads, angelfish and reds to bite. Park admission is $3.25 a car; visiting the fort is $2 a person. The park is open 8:00 until sundown; the fort from 9:00 to 5 p.m."

Order one of the house martinis at the bar (the Pink Lemonade has Absolut Citron vodka, Grand Marnier, and cranberry, lime and pineapple juices) or one of the 17 single malt Scotches, then take it out to one of the rockers overlooking the water."

Converted to apartments during the Depression, it has been turned into a neighborhood bistro with a wide-ranging wine list and a menu that ranges from Parmesan-crusted red snapper ($25) to a grilled loin of venison with black currant sauce ($26)."

There are pitchers of iced tea (coffee will run you $1 extra), biscuits to start, then an onslaught of fried chicken, ham, grits, sausage gravy, collard greens and candied yams so sweet you might be tempted to skip dessert.
