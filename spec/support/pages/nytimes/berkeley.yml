  section_title: "Canopy to Campanile"
  content: "No visit to Berkeley is complete without an idyllic stroll under the canopy of old-growth oaks, redwoods and 200-foot eucalyptus trees on the beautiful University of California campus. It’s also an excellent place to survey notable buildings designed by the architects John Galen Howard, Bernard Maybeck and Julia Morgan. For a singular view of the famous Campanile — at 307 feet, it’s the third-tallest carillon and clock tower in the world — take a dip in the rooftop swimming pool in the Hearst Gymnasium. Designed by Maybeck and Morgan, the former women’s gym has three pools; the largest, North Pool, was once used for women’s lifesaving classes and is open to the public with $12 day pass. On the sun-warmed marble pool deck, decorated with cherubs and other ornate statuary, visitors are treated to a tree-level sight line punctuated by the Campanile and other university buildings."

  content: "A half-block from the eucalyptus grove, step off the student-clogged stretch of Center Street and through the black-and-white curtains at Ippuku, where a top-notch selection of sake, shochu and craft beer anchors the front bar, and a deep menu of Japanese small plates can keep you occupied for hours. The long, skinny dining room is a warren of intimate, curtained booths for two and larger, wood-screened tables, ideal for groups, where you remove your shoes. The warm staff is happy to introduce novices to the savory pleasures of casual izakaya-style dining: chicken gizzard skewers, bacon-wrapped mochi, corn fritters, soft-cooked eggs in dashi broth. Three preparations of fresh handmade soba are available on Monday and Tuesday nights. Try the refreshing shochu cocktails made with grapefruit and umeboshi plum."

  section_title: "Mexico with a Twist"
  content: "John Paluska has an interesting pedigree for a restaurateur: For 17 years, he was the manager for the band Phish. He brings Matt Gandin, former chef of San Francisco’s beloved Delfina, into the mix for his latest project, Comal, an upscale Mexican restaurant and cocktail bar with an emphasis on Oaxacan-inspired cuisine: white shrimp ceviche, rock cod tacos with spicy pickled cabbage, spit-roasted whole chicken served family-style with black beans, achiote rice. Rich mole sauces and three kinds of salsa are frequent accompaniments. At the wood-clad bar at the rear of the long, high-ceilinged industrial space, cocktails are expertly prepared with a bit of theater (lots of vigorous two-handed shaking), and they are fierce (the Jack Satan cocktail is made with “infierno tincture,” as well as tequila, hibiscus syrup, lime and salt). On busy nights, a cocktail and chips cart goes around the open-air back patio, ferrying margaritas and guacamole to grateful patrons waiting to be seated. The music is always good."

  section_title: "Stair Masters"
  content: "In the early 20th century, the hill areas of Berkeley were just starting to be developed. The challenge of building streets along contoured land made for long, winding blocks, and pathways sprang up to offer shortcuts between them. These days, there is an extensive system of 136 pedestrian paths, historic staircases and walkways, each assigned official names and numbers by the city. They include greenways, bike paths and leafy, meandering steps up to parks, gardens, trails and rock-climbing areas; for example, the 183 concrete steps up Tamalpais Path lead past a waterfall and fern grotto to a redwood-framed view of Mount Tamalpais itself. The Berkeley Path Wanderers Association puts out a terrific map of all the secret routes and corridors; pick up a copy and set out on your own, or sign up for one of the group’s regular guided walks."

Be sure to check in at the cheese counter — there is a rotating selection of 300 to 400 cheeses you can taste — before heading next door to the pizzeria for lunch and live music."

  content: "Opened in May by two Brooklyn transplants, Christopher Clarke and Lauren Brody-Clarke, La Botella Republic is a rustic, intimate 33-seat wine bar and bottle shop with a focus on Northern California wines and beers. The well-curated list is best sampled in flights, which change frequently; a recent board spotlighted small producers of rich, fruit-forward cabernet sauvignon (Broadside) and syrah (Ledge Vineyards). The Clarkes’ dedication to area purveyors is also reflected in the food menu, which includes salads, pressed sandwiches, and tasting plates of locally made cheeses, charcuterie, and pickles (pop-up dinners are also in the works). The zinc-topped main bar, lined with ornate, antique Mexican tiles, lends character to the stripped-down, high-ceilinged industrial space, and an additional communal table contributes to the convivial feel. A selection of ciders and sparkling meads rounds out the drinks menu."

After a devastating fire last year, the legendary restaurant reopened with a face-lift, but everything from the remodeled porch and spiffed-up new facade to the cutout copper lamps is still true to the Craftsman spirit of the original. And the service is as pitch-perfect as always — friendly but not overly solicitous, attentive but not fawning — each member of the staff attuned to a clientele that may arrive in formal attire or flip-flops. A recent cafe dinner menu included corn and goat cheese pudding soufflé, skirt steak with borlotti beans, and a nectarine galette that tasted just like summer."
