      Daniel in New York) and his wife, Nyna, have pioneered French-inspired, locally
      sourced cuisine such as venison with sunchoke, or green apple granita with celery,
      pomegranate and, yes, snow.

      and some outstanding daredevil terrain parks — including a two-story halfpipe
      designed by Sean White — Northstar is perhaps the most family friendly of Tahoe's
      diverse slopes.
