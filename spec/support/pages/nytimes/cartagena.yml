    :street_address: Plaza de la Trinidad, No. 10-19
    :website: http://www.facebook.com/www.demente.com.co
    :notes: Emblematic of this fast-changing, formerly working-class neighborhood,
      Demente is a trendy tapas bar housed in what is supposedly the area's oldest
      home. ... With one of the few beer taps in the city, an impressive selection
      of imported booze and a tapas menu that may include small plates like sardinas
      a la plancha (grilled sardines, 8,500 pesos) and the gazpacho-like cold soup
      salmorejo con jamón Serrano (9,000 pesos), Demente is a prime spot for passing
      time before Cartagena's notoriously late-night night life gets going.
