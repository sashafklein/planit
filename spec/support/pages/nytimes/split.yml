    :notes: Housed in a 1792 building that was the city's first hospital, the nearly
      24,000-square-foot space is now a bright and airy spot in which to explore the
      works of not just Croatian artists, but also those from the former Yugoslavia
      and Czech Republic. Be sure to stop at the gallery's breezy outdoor terrace
      cafe for coffee or a cocktail.

    :notes: It goes without saying that the most appropriate first meal in this seaside
      city involves fresh fish from the Adriatic. Look no further than Nostromo  not
      surprisingly a short casting distance (across the street) from the fish market.
      Before ordering some delectable starters (fried anchovies, an aromatic fish
      soup and a tangy Dalmatian octopus salad) choose your main course from a platter
      of raw fish, including sea bream, tuna, sea bass and scorpion fish.

      of Croatian olive oils, along with olives, sweets and wines, but it also has
      a bar and restaurant. Reserve ahead for dinner, as the daily menu draws crowds,
      as does the decor  wooden tables, garlands of hanging garlic cloves and shelves
      of olive oil.

    :notes: Given how bustling the ancient palace is today, it is hard to imagine
      how the Roman Emperor Diocletian built this now-sprawling maze of passageways
      and courtyards to be not just his home but a military fortress.

      the center courtyard outside the Lvxor Cafe. The waiters will find you since
      they frequently have musicians playing for their outdoor guests.

    :notes: In this public space bordering the front of Diocletian's Palace, you can
      count the number of languages you hear, while sipping a nightcap at one of the
      cafes tucked under a row of white awnings, and watching the boats (island ferries,
      cruise ships, fishing vessels and sailing rigs) bob in the harbor.

    :notes: While the most popular club scene is a ferry ride away on the island of
      Hvar, Split also has night life, though the best spots are farther down around
      the Bavcice beach area. This purple lit club should check all the boxes (a dipping
      pool, plasma screens, lounge chairs and a circular bar).

    :notes: Walk along the harbor sidewalks to Galerija Mestrovic, a museum originally
      designed by one of Croatia's most famous artists, Ivan Mestrovic, to be his
      home, studio and exhibition space. Here at the sweeping structure Mestrovic
      built in the 1930s, you will see all forms of his work. Inside, you will find
      his carvings in marble, bronze and wood. The gardens are filled with more of
      his striking sculptures, but it is the view of the sea and islands that will
      vie for your attention.

    :notes: Stop at F de Mar for lunch, a waterside restaurant, with blue and white
      striped awnings and matching seats. Recent dishes included a delicate fish carpaccio
      in a white balsamic vinaigrette, and a prawn risotto sprinkled with pine nuts
      and chopped sun-dried tomatoes and accented with pesto. This is the perfect
      place to lose yourself during your final hours in Split, mesmerized by the boats
      and the lapping sea.

      with sugar, to name two. Then take in the scene  children jumping off rafts,
      boys on Jet Skis and old men and women diving expertly into the turquoise water.'
