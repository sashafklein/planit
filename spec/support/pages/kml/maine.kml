        Jessica Spradling recommends: our favorite neighborhood restaurant (we lived about two blocks away). They have good dinner and a great brunch (pan-seared trout with eggs and bacon). If you walk up a couple blocks further on Congress, you'll be on the Eastern Promenade, which has a great view of Casco Bay, some trails to walk, benches, access to the narrow-gauge railroad which runs along the bay (which has some distinction like the oldest/only surviving narrow-gauge railroad in the country). (I never actually took a ride on it - the path it runs along is an easy walk.)

        Jessica Spradling recommends: if you want the Portland beer-culture experience, this is our favorite bar. Their menu is literally a book of beers, since they also "age" beers in bottle in a "beer cellar," something I'd never heard of before. They're quite friendly, too. Rising Tide is a favorite local beer  brewer (made by one of Jessica's judge's former clerks, in fact) - you'll see their beers (all good) at Novare as well as Pai Men and elsewhere.

Mostly known for its ramen bowls but they raise their own pigs for the pork belly, raise their own chickens for the grilled skewers, etc. Of the out-of-town guests we've taken here, everyone's left raving about it

      <description>
        Jessica Spradling recommends: right near Eventide is this Italian grocery store that you might really like. Small but great selection, as well as those things that I always get a kick out of in Italian grocers, like the huge cans of tomatoes, chocolate bars, etc. In back they have a bakery that turns out pizza - you'll be able to find it because it often has a line that wraps around outside the store at lunchtime. The pizza is great - thick slab pieces with a really sweet tomato sauce and salty mozzarella, very simple and satisfying. Their luna bread is supposed to be great, but has been sold out every time we get there.

        Jessica Spradling gives thumbs down: The one counter-advice I'll give you - I'd skip Duckfat, which probably has/will be recommended to you by a million people. You wait in line forever, prices are high, and it's just very good, not great.

        Jessica Spradling recommends: about a year old, oyster bar that also serves small plates. If you like oysters, Damariscotta River oysters from Maine are a real treat (that I hadn't ever seen elsewhere), a great mix of briny and savory - they usually have four or five different types oysters from along the Damariscotta each day. Prices are expensive if you want to make a meal out of it, since portions on their other dishes are very small (but everything's very good)
