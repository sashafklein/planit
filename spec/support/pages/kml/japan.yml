It was nice (and a nice ride up hills to the spa), but uneven.  Was too late to plan a massage, but tried the communal hot tubs which were lovely (men’s and women’s separately).    Had an enormous Kasekei dinner and big traditional breakfast on the run.  Did not have time to enjoy all of its facilities.  Expensive."

The toilets (immaculately clean and nice) and sinks are in the corridors, typical of a small ryokan.  The small baths, which you reserved a time for were not that nice or hot.  The place grew on me after a day or two, after the Wanosato it was hard to get used to another ryokan.  The neighborhood was delightful.  "
