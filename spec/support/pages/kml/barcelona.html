			<name>Can Marti Restaurant--for Calcots</name>
			<ExtendedData>
			</ExtendedData>
			<description><![CDATA[Passatge de la Font del Mont, 408017 Barcelona, Spain

From Erica on Chowhound: "I was determined to sample calcots during this trip. I had been to Barcelona before but always missed the Jan-March season for this much-beloved variety of winter onion, which resemble the leeks that we have back in the US and are sold in large bundles here in the markets. Although there are restaurants in the city that offer calcots, I wanted to try them grilled over a wood fire in a more rustic setting.

So, yesterday about noon, we set off on the FGC train from Placa Catalunya, getting down about 15 minutes later at Peu de Funicular, north of Sarria on the same train line. There is a funicular here that whisks passengers up the steep Vallvidrera hill to the neighborhood that houses the restaurant.

Unfortunately, the person who answered the phone at the restaurant had assured me that it was only 10 minutes from the train stop to the Can Marti. Did she think I was driving?? She also neglected to mention the funicular!

What ensued was a STEEP walk, that so depleted us that after about 20 minutes of panting, I literally planted myself in the narrow road and flagged down a passing workman in a truck and begged him to give us a lift up the hill.

Can Marti sits amidst private houses in what looks like an upscale suburb of BArcelona; request a window seat and the entire city will spread before you. That is, if you have a sunny day, which we did not. It was cold, drizzly, and a bit foggy.

So the view was compromised, but the food? I loved this place! It would not have been more rustic if it had been in the Cerdanya. The restaurant appears to be a small private home, with a glassed-in dining room at the rear and a large brick grill area set into the back of the house. Piles of wood loom everywhere.

The menu is in Catalan, but they do have one in English as well. (But not in Castillian for some reason!)

Set menus are offered (including a calcotada feast for 30 euro that included a parade of grilled meats, wine, etc) but we chose from the a la carte offerings:

Everything was grilled over the open fire.

Artichoke. (6 euro) delicious!

Torrades amb tomaquet. (here they bring you the toasted bread, along with a few small tomatoes and a garlic clove; oil and salt are already on the table; you make your own pa amb tomaquet)
1.10 euro each)

Calcots. A bundle of about a dozen, along with a bowl of piquant romesco for dipping (one ingredient is secret so I could not get the recipe). 8 euro. Incredibly sweet!! I Loved these charred beauties!! Bibs are supplied but prepare to get very messy!

Mongetas, or white beans 2.90 euro. Excellent--with a crunch on the outside that might have come from bread crumbs.

1/4 rabbit 5.50. My friend thought this gamier than those in the US; I liked it; portion is for small eaters, though.

Costelles de xai, or lamb ribs 14.50 euro. Tiny ribs and one other part of the lamb. Tasty, with char.

With water and house red wine, plus two cafes, the total was 45.80 euro for two.

If you are here in calcot season and you want to sample true Catalan food, I would consider this
restaurant an essential stop on an eating tour. The entire trip from downtown takes under an hour. Do not miss the funicular at the train station. Make sure to sit in the second or third car of the train so you do not miss the short platform at Peu de Funicular.

An afternoon I will not soon forget!

Like most places mentioned below, absurdly cheap by London/NYC standards. The 10-course tasting menu including wine was €65/£46/$82."]]></description>

I would vote for one night at El Gran Café, have you been there>  it is one of the oldest and most beautiful restaurants in bcn.  here:

http://www.diningcity.com/barcelona/restaurantelgrancafe/index_eng.jsp

I went here one night with my dad and ariel!  I love it.  I vote for it for you guys because you can’t get anything like it in SF.  Some of the newer chicer catalan cuisine places  -- amazing for their sci fi food — have pretty boring ambiences.  So I would go to this place one night for ambience and old fashioned catalan food."]]></description>
