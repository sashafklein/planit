For cartagena

Places we recommend:
Ceviche (definitely recommend) - https://foursquare.com/v/la-cevicheria/4b522171f964a520506a27e3
Gelato - https://foursquare.com/v/gelateria-paradiso/4e35cbf452b17fb1c60c3bff
Bar/nightlife - https://foursquare.com/v/cafe-havana/4d1aba55eab1224b74b9cce2

Other places we went that were good, but not as strongly recommended

https://foursquare.com/v/malagana-caf%C3%A9--bar/4eed6c640e61a4186537352e
https://foursquare.com/v/restaurante-la-perla/4d041e980e49721e82376f7f

I would definitely suggest staying in the old town area (nearer the places above) and not down the peninsula (bocagrande)

we stayed around Calle 85 and Carrera 11 so a lot of our recs will be focused on north Bogota


Julia (Calle 85 #12-81, Bogotá) - great pizza

La Arepería Venezolana (Cll 85 (13 - 16)) - a local breakfast food, it was pretty tasty. not amazing but worth checking out probably.

Tábula (Calle 29Bis No. 5-90) - perhaps our favorite restaurant in bogota, definitely recommend.

Bandido Bistro (Cl 79B 7-12) - best local bar scene we found. live music when we were there.

Andrés D.C. (Cll 82 (12-21)) - I think this a 5 or 6 story restaurant. quite a scene. very good charcoal-cooked filet. definitely recommend, but try and get reservations.

69 Oyster Bar (Calle 69 (Cra 5), Bogotá, Bogota) - great seafood and really nice chef, but we were literally the only people in the restaurant *all* night so the atmosphere wasn't great, hah.

El Coq (Cll. 84 # 12 - 02 (Calle 85)) - proto-hipster bar and lounge scene. decent.

Central Cevichería (Kr 13 85-14 (Esq. Cl 85)) -- good ceviche and was right by our hotel.

Matiz (Calle 95 # 11A - 17) - good seafood but don't go out of your way for it.

80 sillas - our one bad dinner experience. skip.

Juan Valdez - local coffeeshop chain. nothing special in coffee-terms, but these were our morning coffee place of choice.

Bogota Beer Company - local chain that's got pretty decent beer choices (best I've found in south america actually).

in terms of touristy things, we liked the botero museum, the gold museum, and monserrate. we also enjoyed walking around in the Plaza de Mercado de Paloquemao, lots of interesting fruits and veggies. I think our favorite though was the bogota bike tour -

biking in bogota traffic was scary at times, but I think this was the best way to get a feel for the city.
