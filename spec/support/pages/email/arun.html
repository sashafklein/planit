Do you have travel plans/tips for Colombia you'd share? (friend of Raven's) 

Hey, sure no problem. How long would you want to go for? More city or outdoors preference?
10 days if we can swing it over Thanksgiving
kindof both  if possible

thats about how long we went for
awesome -- it sounds magical... but ya I have no idea other than cartagena/bogota

You can fly to Cartagena for about $450 rt from nyc. I'll just tell you what we did...

So we flew to CTG, stayed for 3 days. There's lots of beaches, old city, more Caribbean feel of a place in general. Lots of ceviche.  Scuba diving was decent.

Then we flew in to Pereira and drove to Salento which is where the coffee region is. Look up "wax palm trees of salento" or something like that and you'll see some amazing pics. We did a 7 hour hike with a guide one day there and spent 2.5 days there total. Was my favorite part of the trip.

Then flew to Bogota and spent another 3 days there before coming back. Bogota is interesting, but wasn't my favorite. Dirty, big and quite dilapidated in some parts. Fun stuff to do still, so go if you'll be in Col.  There's other citites we didnt hit like Medellin and Bucaramanga
hmmm
and medellin was too similar
to cartagena?
in DNA?
to do along with it?

i think it'd feel different, probably more similar to bogota

since it's not on the coast

id say it's too much to go to all though
ah i thought it was a beach town ahha
ok

paragliding there is supposed to be great
and driving aroudn the mountains/salento
not dangerous? weird?

we did it near salento and it was good too
cool

no, was awesome, highly recommend
you rented a car?

no you have to fly cartagena to coffee region and then to bogota
but the driving around pereira
salento
was rented car? or guide/driver?

you could, we just took taxis

they arent that expensive

and salento is small so you dont need a car
got it
cool!
any must-not-miss restaurants/bars?

la cevicheria in cartagena was great

a bit toursty, but it's wonderful
