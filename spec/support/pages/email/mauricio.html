Hey Niko,

I have to say: very well planned trip... since you are going to the three places I would most definitely suggest for a a week or two in Colombia (not Columbia, Rachel you've learned your lesson).  
Bogotá is a big "business city", with not a lot of sightseeing to do (except for maybe a couple of places that are a must), but it compensates for by having great restaurants, bars, clubs, and shops.  For dining, it really depends on what you want to have, but the one and only place that is an absolute must is called Andrés Carne de Res (http://www.andrescarnederes.com/es/andres_chia) .  There is no easy way to describe it as it is a restaurant (great steaks and local cuisine), that turns into a disco as the night falls.  It is about a 30 min drive away, would be great for Saturday night or Sunday lunch... Other of my favorite places for dining are Watakushi, Black Bear, Cevicheria Central, Bandido Bistro, and Cacio & Pepe. I will be here on the weekend when you guys come, and leave on Monday, so drinks it is.  Where are you staying?

Tayrona is beautiful, just a wonderful place to relax and enjoy the beach, and Cartagena is the place to visit in Colombia.  It is a lot more touristy than Bogotá, so more expensive as well.  I have some suggestions there on what to do and where to go than I can tell more about here.

Please feel free to drop me an email or call me if you have any questions, or just need anything.

See you guys here!

Mauricio,

Would love your tips on what to do / where to go -- I'm headed to Colombia with my girlfriend in a little over than a week (Bogota 22nd-25th, Tayrona 26-28, Cartagena 28-31).  And if you're around, maybe we can grab drinks?

Niko

Hi Niko and Mauricio!

Mauri - Niko grew up in DC and his parents were pretty close with mine. We took a vacation or two together, etc. He lives in San Francisco now, and I haven’t seen him in ages, but I’m pretty sure that you two will get along great.

Niko - Mauricio and I were in grad school together. He is a snob about food and drink, and therefore will have a lot of good Bogota suggestions. He may even be around to meet up (I have no idea of your schedule)! The only thing that I would recommend is to NEVER spell the country “Columbia” so that he can see - he goes from 0 to super mad in about .25 seconds!

I hope that you all manage to connect!
xx Rachel
