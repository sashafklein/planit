So we didn't stay in Bogota, just flew through, so I got nothing on that.  

But we did do Ecohabs in Tayrona.  It's definitely nice, the beach is great and the beds are very comfortable and there's incredible views.  It's an experience for sure.  There's all these lizards everywhere (including on the ceilings in the rooms) and wonderful hammocks that look out over the ocean and the ability to order drinks at the beach (and oh man, the beaches are incredible!)  But, it's definitely upscale in terms of who's staying there and we hiked from there over to the beach at Cabo and passed through the campground at Arricifes and that looked like a lot of fun so I think it's a question of what you want.  If you want a night of living a little plush (in a great but weird jungle kind of way) than I'd do a night at Ecohab, but if you want to be around a lot of travelers and in a more fun, communal atmosphere, I'd do the campgrounds.  Either way, I highly recommend you do the hike to cabo or la piscina (beaches).  There's incredible scenery both inland and on the ocean and just a very cool experience.  And on that front, bring lots bug spray and sunscreen.  It's very warm humid now and I'm guessing will be more so when you are there.  Also make sure you have pesos.  This is kind of an obvious one and you'll be coming from Bogota so of course you will, but we flew in in the middle of the night and were not able to change and in the other places in s. america where we were, they we happy to get the dollars or could take a credit card, but not so in Tayrona.

Cartagena has kind of two separate sections, there's the old city consisting of two neighborhood (San Pedro and San Diego) which is great for walking around during the day and going out to lunch and/or dinner and looking at crafts and that kind of stuff.  And then there's where the nightlife is (and holy cow it's amazing!) which is in a neighborhood called Getsimane.  We didn't spend enough time in Getsimane and I think there's amazing restaurants there too, but I'd definitely recommend doing a few meals in the old town.  If you can, you should definitely go to a restaurant called La Vitrola (in San Pedro).  You'll probably need to make a reservation and it's not cheap (though not expensive by American standards), but it's amazing.  We were also highly recommended to go to a place called Malagnana (I think it's in Getsimane) but we didn't have time to get there.  As far as going out at night, Getsimane is just kind of bar after bar, a lot of them with live music and people dancing (such amazing dancers here!) and there's also square called Santa Teresa where people are just hanging out and playing music and going from bar to bar that supposed to be wonderful.  I don't really have a specific bar recommnedations.  We went to a wonderful one last night, but we were just following around some people we met and I don't remember what it was called.  But I don't really think you can go wrong.

That's what I got off the top of my head.  Let me know if you have questions, happy to answer any and all that I can.  I've heard Bogota is wonderful and I can definitely vouch that you're doing to have a wonderful time in the other two places.  Have fun!

Also, did you guys stay in the ecohabs in Tayrona? We're thinking of doing one night there but not fully convinced it's worth the $, so I'd love to hear what you thought if you guys stayed there!
