Hi Leah,

Dinner on the 21st sounds great. In terms of day trips, chingaza is a bit hard to get to. Chicaque not sure about. I would also consider Guatavita. 

Also, I think I would recommend spending at least a night in Tayrona. It takes a bit to get there and out so in order to spend a lot of the day moving around, I think a night in hammocks would be worth it. Those would be my two cents.

As a base near Tayrona, I would stay in Taganga. It's a fun backpacker town with bars and places to dance. I've stayed in two hostels there, casa de Felipe and casa Hugo. Both worked out very well. In Santa Marta I would recommend the hostel Aluna, but I would stay in Taganga over Santa Marta.

For internal flights, you may want to google the airline Viva Colombia. It's out budget airline. It usually works well, but when it doesn't, it's a shit show because they only have 5 planes. They also charge you for bags and stuff like that so it may end up being more expensive than it looks. For other internal Colombia flights, look at Avianca, Copa, and LAN.

mmm sounds so amazing! we talked about Tayrona today and the predicament is that we want to have our own room (since we're usually across the country from each other) but paying $330/night (!) is ridiculous, so I think we landed on staying just outside the park and going in for day trips. The hammocks sound really lovely though and you're one of many to recommend them, so I'll have to keep them on my list for next time. 

We arrive in Bogota on Friday Nov 21st and leave Cartagena on Dec 1st - I think we'll fly to Santa Marta on Monday the 24th or Tuesday the 25th (we might do a day trip to Chicaque and/or Chingaza that Monday or Tuesday). Any thoughts on either of those spots? 

Actually, Niko doesn't get in until late on the 21st - any chance you'd be around for dinner that evening? I think I get in around 5.

Hi Leah,

Very exciting... Remind me the dates again? In Tayrona I wouldn't do econabs. You can just show up and pay $5 per night to sleep in a hammock. Google cabo San Juan del guia to see the area where you can sleep in hammocks. You have to pay something to get into the park. It's about a half hour walk to the beach. Let me know if you have any other questions!

I'm looking at all these crazy ecohabs in Tayrona and trying to figure out what's best. Do you have any words of wisdom?? Or is there another place we should be looking?
