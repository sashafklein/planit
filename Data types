HOW TO SYNC GIT

Go to Terminal
Go to planit directory (`code planit`)
Check file changes (`gs` -- "git status")
Add ("stage") ALL changes (`ga .` -- "git add .") -- the . means the present directory
  - `ga -u .` as well, if you want to add deleted files
Commit files (`gc -m "Comment about changes"` -- `git commit`)
